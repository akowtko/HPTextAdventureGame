# Harry Potter Text Adventure Game
Written in Prolog. Navigate to the directory where the 'spamventure.pl' file is stored, run the program within Prolog by typing '[spamventure].' and start the game by typing 'start.'

At the beginning the game will ask for a name. Remember to input these as strings followed by a period: 'Nicole'.
When possible locations are listed, navigate there using the go() command. If the location is more than one word, input it as a string, for example: go('Inside Ollivanders'). When you reach a new location, it will also list items that you may take, using the take() command. Yet again, input the item's name as a string, and remember to end all commands with a period.

The game randomly generates wand types in Ollivander's shop, and allows the user to choose a friend group. In addition, the user goes through the sorting hat ceremony based on the Pottermore quiz. Text used in the adventure game is from "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone", which I do not claim any rights to.
